Pseudo code for heater controller loop errors


Every 200 ms:
	if(sensor available): (i2c data)
		read temperature
	Else:
		LoopErrCtr +=1 

If (temperature on the loop < 0.1) and (heater turned on): 
	Loop alarm 2 //Open or Short circuit on sensor
Every 2 s:
	interval = time passed since the last temperature changed
	if (heater turned on at 100%) and (interval >= tmoutsec *1000):
		Loop alarm 1 

Every 16.5 s (numLoops * 220 * LoopErrCtr) (5*220*15):
	If LoopErrCtr> sumErr:
		temperature on the loop = 0
		LoopErrCtr = 0

	
	









Write the use cases for different mode of failures in the temp control system
1.	Broken temp sensor
2.	Unplug sensor
3.	Short circuit sensor
4.	Heater turned on and temperature going up a little bit, but not reaching desired temperature within a certain time
a.	Heater is unplugged or broken wire at the beginning – temperature will stay fairly constant, output of pid will go to 100%
b.	Variation on A above -Temperature rise very slowly because of surrounding temperature but will never reach target temp.  Slope will be low.
c.	Heater working normal and temperature gets up to setpoint but the heater breaks, temperature will drop slowly and pid will eventually go to 100%


Do not want to cause alarm on real world scenario ie. When adding material to a tank, the temperature will drop. 

Temperature sensor value, pid value, setpoint, time,
Time and pid at 100%



























Write new pseudo code for number 4:

When output enabled(run once):
	Time0 = currenttime();
current temperature = temp[loopCtr];
	Temperature_interval = target – current temperature
	Heater_pluged = false

If (heater turned on at 100%):
	If (! Heater_pluged):
	If (very long timeout interval passed):
			Loop alarm 1
If (temp increased by 10% of Temperature_interval): 
				Heater_pluged = true
				Currenttemp = temp[loopCtr]
				Slope = (currenttemp - Temp_setpoint)/ (currenttime() - time0)
				oldtime = curenttime
	If (Heater_pluged):
		New_timeout = slope/(10 % Temperature_interval)
		If(new_timeout passed):
			If (temp increased by 10% of Temperature_interval):
				Slope = 

		
		
		
		
	
		
	
	

	

if (heater turned on at 100%) and (interval >= tmoutsec *1000):
		target reached = true;

			

		

If (heater turned on at 100%) and
 (temp didn’t increase by 50% of (target temperature-starting temperature) within some second: 
	Loop alarm1
If (heater turned on at 100%) and
 (temp didn’t increase by 25% of (target temperature-starting temperature) within some second: 
	Loop alarm1
If (heater turned on at 100%) and
 (temp didn’t increase by 50% of (target temperature-starting temperature) within some second: 
	Loop alarm1




	temp_interval = temperature increased 
	if (heater turned on at 100%) and (interval >= tmoutsec *1000):
		Loop alarm 1 

	if (heater turned on at 100%) and (interval >= tmoutsec *1000):
		target reached = true;

	if(

	if(target reached and output enabled) 
If (temperature  <  temperature * 90%)
	Heater error
